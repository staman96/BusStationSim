DIT  Operating Systems 2019 Project 3


General:

The execution command is:

    ./mystation -l config.txt -f 2 
-f is the bus process creation frequency and -l is the configuration file. The input arguments initialize with default values, so they are optional. The project is developed in C++. The compilation is done with the 'make' command, and 'make clean' deletes all executables and .Î¿ files. The output file is IO/log.txt. Also, with the command 'make cleanOuts', there is an option to erase the output file. I also used Valgrind to check for memory leaks with the command:

    make clean && make && valgrind -v --leak-check=yes --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --trace-children=yes ./mystation -l config.txt -f 2

******************************************************************

Shared Memory Structure:

Class stationDATA contains all semaphores and variables used for the communication between inbound/outbound bus processes. There is an array of aisles (class Bay) with different amount of parking space.


* size of stationDATA
* totalbays * size of Bay(baysOffSet)
* total parking slots of each bay * size of Bus(busesOfBaysOffSet)

Semaphores:

* CommBusWrote, CommStMngrWrote: Used to synchronize the communication between inbound bus and station manager (starting value: 0)
* inDriveway: depicts the road from the entrance till the parking (starting value: 1)
* outDriveway: depicts the road from the parking till the exit (starting value: 1)
* inBoundQueue: It's a queue for the bus processes waiting to enter the parking.
* outGoingQueue: It's a queue for the bus processes waiting to exit the parking.
* OutGoingComm: Used to synchronize the communication between inbound bus and station manager (starting value: 0)

Mutexes:(starting value: 1)
* inBoundMutex: it's used to sychronize all entrace operations
* outGoingMutex: it's used to sychronize all exit operations
* bayMutex:it's used to sychronize access on the aisles and the bus parking spots
* coutMutex: it's used to sychronize concurrent prints

Notes:

Memory is a snapshot of the station. Each bus process, and station manager processes, write on the shared memory. The Comptroller process saves snapshots of the station to the ledger to extract statistics.
The configuraion file's format is as follows:

1 1 1 #parking_aisles (ASK PEL VOR)

5 6 7 #parking_aisles_capacity_per_type (ASK PEL VOR)

50 #bus_max_capacity

20 #bus_max_period_time_at_aisle

1 #maneuver_time

12 4 #comptroller_intervals(stat_snapshot) (stat snap)

2 2 4 #buses_of_each_type (ASK PEL VOR)


The space seperated values in front correspond to the aisle types in brackets(ASK, PEL, VOR).
